# Web Application

## Overview
This is a simple web application built using React. It serves as a starting point for building modern web applications with a component-based architecture.

## Project Structure
```

├── public
│   └── index.html         # Main HTML file for the web application
├── src
│   ├── components
│   │   └── App.js         # Main React component
│   ├── styles
│   │   └── main.css       # CSS styles for the application
│   └── index.js           # Entry point for the JavaScript code
├── package.json            # npm configuration file
└── README.md               # Project documentation
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd web-app
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application
To start the development server, run:
```
npm start
```
This will launch the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production
To create a production build of the application, run:
```
npm run build
```
This will generate an optimized build in the `build` directory.

## Usage
You can modify the components in the `src/components` directory and the styles in the `src/styles` directory to customize the application according to your needs.
